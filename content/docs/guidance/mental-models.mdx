Mental models form a person's internal representation of external reality, including ideas, people, objects, or systems. It is an internal mechanism for humans to represent the world in simpler forms that would otherwise be a load of complex information to understand literally.

Working with AI-powered products, like any other product, has an associated mental model from its users. HCAI solutions should work within existing mental models and set expectations on what it can and cannot confidently perform in order to build appropriate levels of trust.
