While agency of an AI solution can be translated on a linear 0-5 scale, AI is not always accurate, valuable, or necessary in a human's given context. HCAI systems must provide the necessary balance between when an AI model's capabilities shine versus when to provide the user with finer control and input options to intervene, override, or guide model behavior.
