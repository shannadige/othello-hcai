AI models are well-known for their ability to optimize their outputs from reinforcement learning techniques. In new user needs, contexts, and goals, HCAI systems need methods and interfaces that support adaptive behavior when it is required by the user. (Conversely, users will develop new mental models as they learn about these emerging capabilities and should be managed to continue expectation-setting.)
