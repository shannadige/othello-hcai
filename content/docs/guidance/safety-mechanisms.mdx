In scenarios where AI acts in greater waves of agency and non-determinism can't be prevented, risks to users and others can lead to unforeseen negative impacts. While there are methods to learn, prepare, and monitor for potential risks in development, HCAI systems should have context-built pathways built that navigate the user away from errors and failures.
