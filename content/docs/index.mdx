Othello is an open-source UX playbook aimed to address the nuances of designing for AI.

The technology landscape is evolving at a rapid and unprecedented pace. Our mission is to create a source of truth that bridges the gap between the emerging paradigm of AI-driven experience with the existing constructs of human control and agency. We address all AI solutions as Human-Centered AI (HCAI).

The Othello playbook should not be treated an overriding single source of truth â€” we acknowledge that there are many different POVs from unique backgrounds and contexts that define HCAI their own way. Our team wants to give you a space amongst vast internet resources that references research-backed frameworks, ethical considerations, and applied design patterns to create the best HCAI experiences that are transparent, empowering, and human-centered.

Thank you for taking the time to visit this documentation. You can visit https://github.com/shannadige/othello-hcai to contribute to the project or leave feedback for changes.
