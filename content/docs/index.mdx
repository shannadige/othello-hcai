Othello is an open-source UX playbook aimed to address the nuances of designing for AI.

As AI interfaces transform how humans interact with technology, designers face unprecedented challenges and opportunities that require fundamentally different approaches than traditional interface design.

## Why Othello?

In today's rapidly evolving landscape where AI is reshaping design:

- **Traditional interaction models no longer apply** to probabilistic, generative systems
- **Users form new mental models** of what AI can and should do, often with misconceptions
- **Ethical considerations** become design requirements rather than afterthoughts
- **Designers must balance automation with human agency** in unprecedented ways

Othello bridges the gap between traditional interaction design and the emerging paradigm of AI-driven experiences. We provide UX designers, product creators, and organizations with research-backed frameworks, ethical considerations, and practical design patterns to create AI experiences that are transparent, empowering, and human-centered.
