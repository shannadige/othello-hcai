### In marketing

People learn and receive information about a product before even interacting with the product. They get this information through various sources, not limited to marketing, news, and experiences with other products.

When positioning your own product, consider that using sorts of buzzwords as a way to market capabilities of AI may setup the product for disappointment. Many companies today include marketing messages such as "AI-powered" or "magic" within their positioning of a new AI product or feature to their relevant market. Much of this marketing overestimates what the product/feature can actually do.

Calibrating users' expectations to what your AI solution will do for them is a twofold process:

1. Deliver messaging that is balanced in what the AI solution **can and cannot do**.
2. Deliver messaging that is balanced in simple, direct, and accessible messaging without being overly technical or complex.
### For users who are non-experts of technology

Users who aren't technical may use your product as a day-to-day workflow of their everyday lives or on occasion for a necessary outcome. They are not entirely concerned with how the technology works, but rather that it actually works, gets to the outcome they need, and is always correct.

These users have been the largest audience for new AI innovation in the past few years, but the material they ingest from news, marketing, and other products has convoluted their meaning of  "AI-powered" or "magic" solutions.

Approaching this category of users is quite practical: your description of the product's AI solution should be aligned with the inherent benefit that users will get from using its feature(s). This enables users to quickly understand the context of how this new solution will deliver new value within the workflow they are used to performing.

Your users may vary in power usage, so this is not a one-all approach. Some users may want to understand the semantics of what the AI does, they may want to customize how it behaves within the experience, or they may want to disable it outright. Your onboarding experience should consider the users' needs for these levers.

### For users who are already working with AI technology

Users may also be introduced to AI in problem spaces where they have already experienced applications of AI. They are used to working with AI solutions, they notice when one solution works better over another, and they are familiar to what AI can and cannot do.

The familiarity to capabilities comes from this user category's willingness to experiment, in order to maximize the outcomes they receive from AI solutions.

Approaching users who use AI within their existing workflows requires a few more dimensions beyond practical descriptions.
